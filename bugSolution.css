A more robust and maintainable solution avoids the use of `!important` and instead leverages a more strategic approach to CSS specificity:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.exception {
  color: green;
}

.parent .child {
  color: purple;
}

.parent .child.exception {
  color: yellow;
}

/*  If the parent's color must be inherited, you can use the following to override more explicitly */
.parent .exception {
  color: green;
}
```

By structuring the CSS classes effectively and removing unnecessary `!important` declarations, we achieve the desired styling behavior without sacrificing maintainability. The use of more specific selectors makes the styles predictable and easier to reason about.  In this revised version, the `.exception` class overrides the style with a higher specificity, ensuring the correct color application.
